                      <h4>Customer Satisfaction</h4>
                      <p>As demand is driven by your customers' needs, the goal of every manufacturing operation should be to meet their needs. Providing your customers with the product that they want in a timely manner will increase their satisfaction and make them likely to purchase from your business again. Demand forecasting is beneficial here as it will ensure that you have enough inventory to quickly meet the demand.</p>

                      <h4>Inventory Optimization</h4>
                      <p>A thorough analysis of the demand for your products can help you identify products that sell well and others that don't sell as much. This will help you decide which items you should keep a higher inventory for to avoid stock-outs and cause customer dissatisfaction. In addition, demand forecasting will allow you to better plan when to order items that have a long or varying lead-time to ensure that you always have enough on hand.</p>

                        <p>Price changes and promotions represent external factors that can increase the demand for those goods and services. Demand forecasting will help inventory managers know if they should purchase or produce additional products to meet an anticipated demand surge. Effective pricing and promotion planning can help planners maximize the net revenue of the organization.</p>

                      <p>Demand forecasting analyzes historical data for trends and seasonal patterns. Furthermore, it analyzes the overall change of demand related to external factors like promotion campaigns, price changes, or other external factors. This will allow you to have a better understanding of when you should keep more items in stock and when you can keep a lower inventory.</p>

                      <h4>Cost Reduction for Expiring Products</h4>
                      <p>Demand forecasting is especially useful for products that have expiry dates, such as in the food or chemical industries. Without proper demand forecasting, you run the risk of losing money if you produce too many items and have to sell them at a discounted price as their expiration date approaches. In addition, unnecessary storage costs are incurred when you are producing too many products.</p>
